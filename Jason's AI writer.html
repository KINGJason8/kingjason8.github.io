	<h1>English AI Story</h1>
	<p1>Matt Malkovich was thinking about Alison Superhalk again. Alison was a friendly god with pointy feet and wobbly toenails.
Matt walked over to the window and reflected on his cold surroundings. He had always loved chilly Exeter with its barbecued, boiling beaches. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel puzzled.
Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a friendly figure of Alison Superhalk.
Matt gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a stingy, intelligent, cocoa drinker with brunette feet and squat toenails. His friends saw him as a scattered, successful saint. Once, he had even made a cup of tea for an alive baby flamingo.
But not even a stingy person who had once made a cup of tea for an alive baby flamingo, was prepared for what Alison had in store today.
The moon shone like skipping cats, making Matt anxious. Matt grabbed a tattered sandwich that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.
As Matt stepped outside and Alison came closer, he could see the unknown glint in her eye.
"I am here because I want justice," Alison bellowed, in a bold tone. She slammed her fist against Matt's chest, with the force of 8246 elephants. "I frigging love you, Matt Malkovich."
Matt looked back, even more anxious and still fingering the tattered sandwich. "Alison, let's get married," he replied.
They looked at each other with ecstatic feelings, like two horrible, homely hamsters talking at a very optimistic funeral, which had jazz music playing in the background and two scheming uncles jumping to the beat.
Suddenly, Alison lunged forward and tried to punch Matt in the face. Quickly, Matt grabbed the tattered sandwich and brought it down on Alison's skull.
Alison's pointy feet trembled and her wobbly toenails wobbled. She looked confident, her body raw like a bewildered, broad book.
Then she let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Alison Superhalk was dead.
Matt Malkovich went back inside and made himself a nice mug of cocoa.</p1>
THE END 
	<h1>Chinese story</h1>
	<p1>Eric Feng 一直很讨厌小卧室，那是一个无家可归的房子。 这是一个让他感到平静的地方。

他是个臭臭的、耐心的、爱喝啤酒的人，有着粉红色的眼睛和邋遢的脚踝。 他的朋友们认为他是一个长久的、吵闹的情人。 曾经，他甚至还救活了一个奄奄一息的婴儿。 他就是这样的人。

埃里克走到窗前，回想着周围炎热的环境。 雪像狂欢的蜂鸟一样飞舞。

然后他看到远处有什么东西，或者说是某个人。 那是晴天的身影。 桑尼是个大胆的老师，眼睛圆圆的，脚踝湿漉漉的。

埃里克咽了咽口水。 他没有为桑尼做好准备。

当埃里克走到外面，桑尼走近时，他可以看到他脸上悲伤的笑容。

“看埃里克，”桑尼咆哮道，自私的目光让埃里克想起了大胆的獾。 “不是我不爱你，而是我想要一个拥抱，你欠我5559英镑。”

埃里克回头看了看，更加生气了，仍然用手指抚摸着银刃。 “桑尼，我是你的父亲，”他回答道。

他们疑惑地看着对方，就像两只真正的生老鼠在一个非常自私的葬礼上跳来跳去，葬礼上播放着 R&B 音乐，两个漂亮的叔叔也跟着节拍喝酒。

埃里克研究着桑尼圆圆的眼睛和湿漉漉的脚踝。 最终，他深吸了一口气。 “恐怕我宣布自己破产了，”埃里克解释道。 “你永远拿不到你的钱。”

“不！” 桑尼反对。 “你撒谎！”

“我不！” 埃里克反驳道。 “现在，在我用这把银刃打你之前，把你那双胖乎乎的眼睛从这里拿开。”

Sunny 看起来很高兴，他的钱包像一个笨拙的水壶一样破旧。

埃里克真的能听到桑尼的钱包碎成 5559 块的声音。 然后大胆的老师就匆匆向远处走去。

今晚即使喝一杯啤酒也无法平复埃里克的紧张情绪。
